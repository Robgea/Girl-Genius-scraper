# Girl Genius Scraper

This script will scrape the Girl Genius web-comic, download every page, organize the page by Volume, and number them accordingly. 

As of July 9th this works with no problems, and as long as they continue to use the same formatting for the site it should continue to work into the forseeable future. End to end this took 47 minutes to run, so you will need to let this sit for a bit and chug away.  If you want to do this in smaller chunks you can change the init_url variable, but that will almost certainly throw off the numbering system. 

## A plea to support the Artists whose work you consume

So, if you're doing this you either really like webcomics or like Girl Genius. Either one is cool. I really like Girl Genius (even if it does infuriate me sometimes), and I want it to keep going. If you do too I implore you to help support the artists directly and monetarily. The only way we as a society can make sure art is produced is to make sure artists are supported, and there's precious little support for most webcomics out there. So, please, consider signing up for the Foglio's [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/girlgenius), or buying something from their [stores](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/shop.php). It's the least we can do to thank them for the hard work that they do. If you can't, I get it, but if you just won't but want to use this... please reconsider. 

## Future Plans

I'll probably update this periodically to account for volume changes. I may also try to make this something that can store its 'place' and periodically download new comics while tracking the numbering. No guarantees though.
