# Girl Genius Scraper

This script will scrape the Girl Genius web-comic, download every page, organize the page by Volume, and number them accordingly. 

It will also create a shelf-directory to save its place in the comic. This will let a user periodically run the script so as to update their files instead of forcing a new complete run every time. (And it now includes an error catcher that will save your progress should you lose connection during the process of scraping the comic.)

As of November 24th 2019 this runs all the way through the comic, and in its latest run took just under 30 minutes end-to-end. 

## A plea to support the Artists whose work you consume

If you're doing this you either really like webcomics or like Girl Genius. Either one is cool. I really like Girl Genius (even if it does infuriate me sometimes), and I want it to keep going. If you do too I implore you to help support the artists directly and monetarily. The only way we as a society can make sure art is produced is to make sure artists are supported, and there's precious little support for most webcomics out there. So, please, consider signing up for the Foglio's [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/girlgenius), or buying something from their [stores](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/shop.php). It's the least we can do to thank them for the hard work that they do. If you can't, I get it, but if you just won't but want to use this... please reconsider. 

## Future Plans

I'll probably update this periodically to account for volume changes, but those updates may take some time. No guarantees though.
